Observation 1:  The final tumor volume was smaller for mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane compared to the mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin.

Observation 2: The mice treated with Capomulin saw a significant reduction in tumor volume over time, indicating that the treatment was successful. However, we don't know fir sure because we did not plot these results next to the other drugs and more importantly, the placebo. 

Observation 3: There is a correlation of .84 between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume, suggesting that the heavier the mice are, the larger the tumor size.
